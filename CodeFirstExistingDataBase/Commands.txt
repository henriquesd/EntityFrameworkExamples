add-migration InitialModel

This will create our first migration that represents our initial model, so if you run this migration on a blank
database it's going to bring that database up to sync with this model.
But we already have these tables in our database because we started with an existing database. So if you run this
migration now, you're going to get an exception. To resolve this:
When you start with an existing database and you want to create your first migration you need to use a switch that
is called ignore changes; with this switch you tell Entity Framework that whatever you have in your model now, all
of that exist in your database:

add-migration InitialModel -IgnoreChanges -Force

This will create an empty migration.
